# Heartvest - ludum-dare-52 jam

## Background
I shamelessly entered LD52 without any prior game dev experience, and so here we are -- my first game, **Heartvest**.

Only had a few small goals:
1. Get used to Godot over a weekend
2. Use one common game design pattern
3. Submit something finished "enough"

Almost gave up on goal 3, but the hours flew by. Had a lot fun and learned a lot :)
